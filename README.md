# Semi-Classical Particle Simulator 
This project is a semi-classical particle simulator designed to simulate interactions between fermions and bosons within a grid-based environment with Qt visuals. The simulation incorporates probabilistic interactions. Currently, the simulation supports electrons and photons.

Particles can be generated by clicking the simulation zone. This can be done only when paused.
With the slider one can choose the velocity of the generated particles.
