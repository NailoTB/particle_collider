# Semi-Classical Particle Simulator 
This project is a semi-classical particle simulator designed to simulate interactions between fermions and bosons within a grid-based environment with Qt visuals. The simulation incorporates probabilistic interactions where real bosons are created to transfer momentum. Currently, the simulation supports electrons and photons.

TODO: Interactions

## How to Run
