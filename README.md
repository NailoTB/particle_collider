# Semi-Classical Particle Simulator 
This project is a semi-classical particle simulator designed to simulate interactions between fermions and bosons within a grid-based environment with Qt visuals. The simulation incorporates probabilistic interactions. These interactions have two different types: long-range elastic interactions and short-range inelastic interactions.
 
Particles can be generated by clicking the simulation zone. With the slider one can choose the velocity of the generated particles. Currently only electrons can be generated with the UI.
